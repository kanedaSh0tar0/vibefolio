        <p>
          Front-end developer with two years of experience in a dynamic
          environment as a shadow coder. Throughout my career, I have often
          taken on new projects received tasks outside of my area of expertise,
          and quickly learned new technologies and frameworks. It will not be a
          problem for me to switch to working with other technologies.
        </p>
        <p>
          I have a great desire to develop in different directions besides the
          front-end and React environment.
        </p>
      </Content>
    </Wrapper>
